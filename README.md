OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo and I don't even know where to start. That  , man, it's like, how do you even describe it? This girl falling in love with a fairground ride, like what??? Haha! Don’t ask me how I even 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   in the first place, probably some late-night existential crisis about life choices. 😂 But seriously, kinda wild, right? At some points, I was just staring at the screen thinking is this for real?

> Okay, but why was I, a sensible cosmetologist, low-key sensing a deep message in there? 😅 All about finding real connections where you least expect them? Or maybe I’m just tired and overthinking. We have those days, don’t we? 

Haha, and we thought we had dating problems! Imagine being all gaga over something that can’t even text you back! 😜 You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just for that alone, it’s honestly such a trip. Or maybe the missing bolts and screws in my head were connecting more with Jumbo than actual people?? Just kidding—mostly. 😉

Anyway, you know what I mean, life’s randomness is seriously sometimes stranger than fiction. Omg, remember when – oh wait, fuck, I can’t even remember what I was gonna say. Yep, definitely sleep-deprived. 😂

int main(void) { printf(I have no idea why I’m typing this
); return 0; }

So yeah, what about you? How’s everything over there? We seriously need to catch up soon because I need some of your zen energy around me these days. Or at least swap ridiculous late-night   recommendations. 😜
